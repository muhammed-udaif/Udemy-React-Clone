To the people out there considering this course, yes you should close your eyes and pick this course. This course is structured and deep. It will teach you all the neccessary libraries also, take Router, Redux, React Query, NextJs also. My only advice stay away from tutorial hell, and keep making projects, writing code yourself only."},

As with all things tech, new versions of this or that are relaesed all the time and the code needs to be modified ot altered. One good addition that could be made to this course is an extra section on React v19 now that it is out and stable. Thank you."}
